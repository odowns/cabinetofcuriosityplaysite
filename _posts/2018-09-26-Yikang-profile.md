## Awesome Animal Pick

I chose the [Red-lipped Batfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-lipped_batfish) because it has bright red lips, which looks awesome to me. It also has an interesting body part called an illicium on its head that extends outward for attracting prey. Also, its face seems a little unhappy, which is cute and funny.

## Animal Family Member

The red-lipped batfish is part of the [Ogcocephalidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogcocephalidae) family. Members of this family are [anglerfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglerfish) and are not good swimmers, and instead are adapted for life crawling on the sea floor by using their pectoral fins. Researchers believe that the bright red lips of the batfish are used to recognize other batfish during spawning. Another member of the Ogcocephalidae family, a red batfish, is shown below.
